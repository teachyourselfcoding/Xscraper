## Overview

Xscraper is a Twitter/X timeline archiving tool that lets you:
- Scrape tweets (including quoted tweets, with images) for any user and date range.
- Save tweet data and images to a local database and organized folders.
- Browse your collected tweets in a modern web interface with search and filtering.

## 1. Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root with your Twitter/X credentials:
   ```
   TWITTER_USERNAME=your_x_username
   TWITTER_PASSWORD=your_x_password
   ```

## 2. Scraping Tweets

Scrape tweets for any public or private account you have access to.

**Command syntax:**
```
python src/scraper/scraper.py --user TARGET_USERNAME --start-date YYYY-MM-DD --end-date YYYY-MM-DD
```
- `--user` is the Twitter/X handle (without the `@`).
- `--start-date` and `--end-date` are in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

**Example:**
```
python src/scraper/scraper.py --user Mistery5387057 --start-date 2025-08-01 --end-date 2025-08-01
```

- Tweets and images are saved to your local database and into `images/YYYY-MM-DD/` subfolders.

**Notes:**
- Login is automatic; cookies are saved for future sessions.
- Quoted tweets are saved as independent records, with their own images and metadata.
